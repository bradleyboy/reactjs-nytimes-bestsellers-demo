# React + Flux + NYTimes API

Just a little demo to experiment with ReactJS. To run it, clone this repo and do `npm install`. Then, add a .env file with your NYT API key (you can get a free key [here](http://developers.nytimes.com/) in 2 minutes, be sure to get one specifically for the Best Sellers API).

```
NYT_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
```

Then run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:8080
